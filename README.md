Google Contacts Manager in Java
=================================

> Test project to experiment how the the GData API for Java functions.
> This project will expand to be somewhat like a Google Contacts Manager
> The User Interface is done in plane Simple Swing for quick prototype.

Note: You have to download the GData API from Google Code and place the libs
in the /lib/ directory. Then run 'ant' to compile/build the jar, or build it from
Eclipse.  http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/

This depends on Java6
